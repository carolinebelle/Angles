# Lumbar Lordosis Angle Measurement Tool

React JS web app with Firebase backend

## Purpose

Developed for IntuitiveMed LLC for Orthopaedic Spine Research.

### Angle Measurements

Collect 12 lumbar spine angle measurements  from user click or drag input

### Participants

Participants are added to the Firebase database. Session tracking logic (status, progress, number) is managed client-side as each user logs on. This reduces the need for server side logic.

### Communication

Administrators have access to .csv downloads of all data from the web app interface. This allows non-tech admins to access the information they need to keep track of the research progress.
